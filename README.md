# 🤖🔢 AI Number Guesser

This is a simple Python game where the **AI guesses your number** using a binary search algorithm. It's a fun and quick example of how search logic can be applied to create interactive programs.

## 🚀 Features
- The AI intelligently narrows down your number
- Fast guessing using binary search
- Simple and interactive terminal-based game
- Great for learning search algorithms and AI logic basics

## 🧠 How It Works
- You (the user) think of a number within a certain range (e.g. 1–100).
- The AI will ask questions to guess your number.
- You respond with hints:
  - `'h'` if your number is **higher**
  - `'l'` if your number is **lower**
  - `'c'` if the AI **guessed correctly**

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-number-guesser.git
